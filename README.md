Chingu Voyage Project - Surgery Center Status Board
[Project Requirements](https://github.com/chingu-voyages/voyage-project-surgerystatus)
## Overview

Welcome, Chingus!

It's inevitable that at some point in your life you or a loved one will have to undergo
some type of surgery - either as an inpatient or an outpatient. In this event you or a
companion, depending on who's having the surgery, will be in a hospital waiting room while
the surgery is being performed.

It can be quite stressful on the person in the waiting room. But, this can be lessened by
knowing how the surgery is progressing. Like many other activities there is a workflow
associated with any medical procedure and knowing what state or phase the surgery is in 
will help whoever is waiting to know what's going on.

In this voyage, your team will design and build a web application, _Surgery Status Board_,
that will track a patients progress and display it on a monitor in the waiting room.
